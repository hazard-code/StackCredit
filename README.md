# StackCredit - Decentralized P2P Lending Protocol

## Overview

StackCredit is a comprehensive peer-to-peer lending platform built on the Stacks blockchain, enabling direct STX lending between users without traditional financial intermediaries. The protocol provides a secure, transparent, and decentralized solution for credit agreements with automated collateral management and liquidation mechanisms.

## 🎯 Key Features

### Core Lending Functionality
- **Peer-to-Peer Credit**: Direct lending between borrowers and creditors
- **Collateralized Loans**: Over-collateralized credit agreements for security
- **Automated Payments**: Structured installment payment system
- **Liquidation Protection**: Automatic collateral liquidation when ratios fall below threshold
- **Penalty System**: Late payment penalties to incentivize timely repayments

### Advanced Features
- **Flexible Terms**: Customizable interest rates, payment frequencies, and loan durations
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live collateral ratio tracking and risk assessment
- **Transparent Pricing**: Clear fee structure and penalty calculations
- **Administrative Controls**: Protocol governance for risk parameter adjustments

## 💰 Protocol Economics

### Collateral Requirements
- **Minimum Collateral Ratio**: 150% (configurable by admin)
- **Liquidation Threshold**: 130% collateral ratio
- **Over-collateralization**: Protects creditors from borrower default risk

### Fee Structure
- **Late Payment Penalty**: 10% of installment amount
- **No Origination Fees**: Direct peer-to-peer transactions
- **Gas Fees**: Standard Stacks blockchain transaction costs

### Risk Management
- **Automated Liquidation**: Triggered when collateral falls below 130%
- **Payment Tracking**: Comprehensive missed payment monitoring
- **Default Protection**: Collateral seizure mechanisms for creditor protection

## 📋 Data Structures

### Credit Agreement
```clarity
{
    borrower: principal,
    creditor: (optional principal),
    principal-amount: uint,
    collateral-amount: uint,
    interest-rate: uint,
    term-length: uint,
    funding-height: uint,
    last-payment-height: uint,
    payment-frequency: uint,
    installment-amount: uint,
    outstanding-balance: uint,
    agreement-status: string-ascii
}
```

### Repayment Schedule
```clarity
{
    next-due-height: uint,
    missed-payments: uint,
    total-penalties: uint
}
```

## 🛠️ Configuration
